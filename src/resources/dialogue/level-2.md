Cobalt: "Agent Onyx, come in."

Onyx: "..."

### Floor 2

Cobalt: "Onyx answer your damn comms. There’s one final artifact to retrieve, and your window of opportunity is closing quickly."

Onyx: "I’m in, security is extremely tight here. What kind of facility is this?"

Cobalt: "That’s none of your concern. Look, just take one step at a time and watch out for guards."

When the player detects a guard the first time…

Cobalt: "Your gear will alert you when a guard is near. Avoid them, we don’t want any trouble."

When player reaches door without key:

Onyx: "Dammit Cobalt why didn’t you tell me I needed a key."

Cobalt: "Look around the room, the key has got to be nearby."

When the player reaches the door:

Cobalt: "Hurry to the basement, we’re running out of time."

### Floor 3

Cobalt: "Security is going to increase the further we get."

Onyx: "What am I stealing here…?"

Cobalt: "Stay focused!"

Player enters the secret door.
